# JS 233 Lecture 11
## Life Is Beautiful Discussion
- Positive vs. Negative critisism
    - Negative
        - Milking the Holocaust to win Oscars
        - Where is the line drawn where it becomes so unrealistic, that films aren't really about the Holocaust any more
            - Keep people in theaters vs. not portraying anything
        - Could be offencive to people who actaully went through it
        - Makes people feel good about something that was bad
    - Positive
        - Reaches a broader audience
            - Appeals to people who want to know about the Holocaust in a "pleasent" form
        - Portrayed the strength of Jews throught the Holocaust
        - Brought in the innocence of the situation and plays on peoples emotions
    - When do the pros of comedy outweigh the cons

## Shindler's List Discussion
- Definitely attracted audiences to learn more about the Holocaust
- The lesson of this film is that people had options, and to do what you feel is right
- Not necessary for the film to be 100% accurate
- Critisized because as a film that teaches people about the Holocaust, it portrayed something that rarely happened (German saving Jews)
- SHouldn't be a source at all because it distorts the reality of the Holocaust into a "fairy tale"
- Doesn't emphisize the mass murder portion of the Holocaust
- Tradoffs really dont change the story that is being told
- Lots of film choices that show how close to death everyone is
- Makes the Holocaust bearable by distorting it
- Leaves us feeling good about ourselves
- Plays with our emotions like Life is Beautiful
