# JS233 Lecture 2 January 14th 2015
- All of the propaganda films attribute all form of exploitation to the Jews
- Music plays a big role in all of the movies we will be watching
- Labeling Nazis as insane/psycopaths is problematic beacuse it relieves hundreds of thousands of people of the reposibilities and crimes they committed
- Jews shown as the classic middle men who dont create/make anything
    - They are unpreductive towards society
- Crude tools such as maps were fabricated to show how Jews have a stranglehold on the world in terms of the economy.
- 1 in every 2 people in England believe that Jews have too much power
- Many of the issues that we laugh at and think are crude are still believed as fact by some
- Things that the Nazis hate are Jewish, not neccessarily created by Jews
    - Ex. Abstract art, Jazz
    - Reason is because abstract leads to imagination, a form of freedom, whcih the Nazis were against


## Triumph of the Will
- Very patriotic music playing during the description of the German Rebirth
    - Also during Hitlers entrance
    - Everything Hitler related has this music
- Portray hit as God, the new answer to the german people
- Portray Hitler as a personable kind of guy and the German people as prosperous and strong
- Displays the raw devotion and hope that the nation had towards hitler
- Hitler's speaches towards labour do a good job at inspiring the people to follow him
- Every solo shot of an important figure is from below
- Everything the Nazis do is on a HUGE scale, very grand
- A surprising amount of military presence before any wars happened
    - Possible forshadowing?
- Lots of rallys
    - Maybe to inspire the whole nation, one city at a time?
- Making choices, cutting out certain things, all say somthing about what kind of film it is
- There is implied commentary through the images of the film
- No difinitve stance in the film, just a projection of power and divinity
