# JS233 Lecture 3 January 21st 2015
- French were not happy with Night and Fog because there were scenes in which French were aiding in sending Jews to the concentration camps 
- Camp structure included:
    - German Generals at the top
    - Common criminals below them
    - Other prisoners in charge of other tasks

- There were killing camps, along with work camps
    - Most of the transports that came into the concentration camps were sent straight to the gas chambers
    - Others were used for work, medical experiments, etc

- People identities were removed through tattooing a number, shaving heads, removing clothes, pretty much removing everything that makes them unique

## Night and Fog vs Triumph of the Will
- TotW never lets you reflect on what you are seeing, because there really is nothing to reflect about
- TotW removes individualism, the bad parts, basically is very well edited
- NaF purposely asks you questions on what you are seeing so that you can reflect
- NaF opening alludes at the fact that the camps were seamlessly integrated into society, and that the prisoners were made fully aware that the aspects of life are going on as usual around them
    - Maybe by means of humiliation and dehumanization
    - Don't be fooled by the innocence of the landscape today, don't forget about what happened
- Some images/scenes are used in both movies, but in different contexts
    - TotW builds up admiration using these images
    - NaF uses them to show a link between the dictatorship and the concentration camps
- Where there is no hope of resistance accomplishing physical survival, the idea of resistance was to do small acts to carry on your memory
    - Must be seen as valiant as going down fighting
- NaF: who is responsible scene, every one says they are not responsible and then asks you question it

##Leni Riefenstahl Interview Movie
- Defending the fact that she was not in politics, and it was simply a film about an event
- If people were to make films of leaders today, whom turned out to be horrible people, is it the film makers fault?
- Shaped the film by editing it the way that she did
    - Put an insane amount of effort put into editing the film
- Film has nothing about hate, it's all about peace
    - Could be turned around to say that she intentionally hid stuff from the film, but there is no proof of that
- Paid by the politicians to film certain events, so the actual speeches given could have been made to compliment that
    - All of these are just allegations though with no proof
- Apologized that people took her film the wrong way, and regrets that she made it because it ruined her career
    - Instead of apologizing for making a film that led to what was eventually the holocaust
    - Revels the kind of person she was
- No matter what kind of profession you are, you have to take responsibility for you actions and what they lead to

##  Wannsse Conference (docudrama)
- Previously, jews were being killed off with gas trucks
    - Clearly not efficient since the ghettos were overflowing
- Can get a sense of how little they value jewish life when they describe breaking trains a tragedy because jews were frozen to the seats
- Mixed statements: Jews get all the money yet contribute to all the debt
- Officers are not told to think about the big picture
    - Keeps people from having to worry and just do
