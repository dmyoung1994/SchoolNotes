# JS 233 Lecture 10: More Shoa
## Discussion
- Workers around the camps just go along with their daily lives and get used to the screaming.
- Interviewer is not making things about survival, just death
    - Believes the Holocaust was about death
- Deminican Republic only country the would allow Jewish refugees out of the 32 in the decision
- Canada didn't really let in Jews until they let in few orphans
    - None is too many
- SS officers we're allowed to use the word "corpse" or "victim", instead calling the dead Jews, wood, shit, etc...
    - Jews weren't considered human beings
## Shoa - Interview with SS commander of Warsaw Ghetto
- Nazi commisioner of the Warsaw ghetto completly forgot about everything he was in charge of
    - Takes notes of the diary entry
- "I want money not to buy food, but to pay rent because I do not want to die in the streets"
    - Preserve dignity through life in the ghetto
    - Death was not avoidable
- SS guy doesnt remember anything about dead people, just about the danger to himself like diseases
    - only cares about preserving the labour force
- Also doesnt really care that 5000 people a month died in his ghetto
    - Even though his job was to keep the ghetto alive
- Existance of deathcamps was already known before the deportation from the ghettos
- How can the Jews be better informed than the Nazis that were running the ghetto and everything
    - With the "secret services"
- SS guy is still in the grips of anti semitism
- Death is talked about so openly in these interviews, like it doesnt even matter to any one
- "Jewish ghettos worked well for self preservation"...
    - How can he possibly say this when people were dying left right and center
- When Czernyakov realizes he cant do anything about the Jews, he kills himself

## Shoa - Polish Villagers
- Jewish women did no work and were rich
    - Anti-Semetism carries through and so do steroetypes
    - "Capital was in the hands of the Jews"
- This notion that the Jews ran everything is so built into the villagers lives
    - Its crazy!
- It really bugs me that whenever they are talking about Jews, it seems like they are seperate from people
    - Like some segregated part of the village and not like the others
    - Even 20+ years after the Holocaust happened

## Shoa - Gas Van Memo
- Memo is oddly desturbing because they are taking into account people (or merchendise, or load) rushing to the exits as they are gased to restore balance to the vehicles
- Light a lamp inside so that people dont scream and rush to the doors
- Drainage pipe for easy cleaning
- Very methodicly rested and designed
- Interesting use of language to hide what the true purpose is

## Shoa - Nazi SS commandant
- 18,000 number being an exxageration:
    - Arguing over 15,000 like it made any difference.
    - Still a crazy amount of people to "process" each day
- "We didnt have proper uniforms, we were cold as hell too"
    - While there are people standing there naked waiting to be killed
- Huge contrast between this guy who remembers every single little detail and the other SS guy in charge of the warsaw ghetto

## Shoa - Barber
- Hair used to be cut off in the gas chamber
    - Moved to the undressing barracks
    - They didn't shave the hair, and made them believe they were just getting a nice haircut, instead of going to their deaths
- Feelings dissapeared when in the camps
- Everyone knew that if they told the prisioners about teh gas chambers, they would share the same fate
    - So they spent time with them, holding them a little bit longer
