## Earth 122 Lecture 11
- Deforestation taking place at a high rate
- Fishbone type patterns appearing in teh forests (logging roads)
- Exposes soil which leaves it open to washing away when it rains
- Vegetation communities change along altitude of mountain slopes
    - Deserts -> Woodlands
- Areas equivilent to biomes exist in the oceans
    - They are shaped by:
        - Water temperature, salinity, dissolved nutrients
        - Wave actions, currents, depth
        - Substrate type:
            - Rocks -> lobsters, sea urchen

## Chapter 6: Human Population
- Case Study: China's one-child policy
    - By 1970, China had 790m people
    - Such a big population contributed to environmental degredation
    - One child policy decreseased growth rate to 0.5%
    - Had unintended concequences
        - Killing female infants
        - Unbalanced sex ratio
        - Black-market trade in teenage girls
- Human Population recently passed 7b
    - Incresing in most developing countries
    - Really took off after 1800
- At todays 2.1% growth rate, the population will double in 33 years
    - Rule of 70: 70/2.1 = 33
    - Growth rate in Canada is 0 - 0.075%
    - European countries are low
    - Middle Eastern countries are high
- 1766: Thomas Malthis
    - Growing population is eventually checked by limits on birth or increases in deaths
1968: Paul Ehrich
    - Poulation is growing too fast and must be controlled
