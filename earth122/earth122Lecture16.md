# Earth 122 Lecture 16
## Chapter 10
- Better policies can be made so that we can do palm oil plants in a sustainable fashion
- **Deforestation**: clearing and loss of forests
    - fuled the growth of the 20th century
    - Old growht forest
    - Altered landscapes
        - greatest impact in toripical and drylands
        - fastes in tropical rainforrests of latin america
- **Swidden agriculture**: small areas of forest cleared and crops planted
- Grazing impacts soil and grasslands
- **Adaptive Management**: sustematically testing different management approaches and aiming to improve methods
    - Walter did this for quary companies
        - Take resources carfully
    - Time consuming and expensive
    - Government agencies included

## Forest Fires
- Many ecosystems depend on fires
- By suppressing fires, kindling accumulates and raises the risk of fires
    - Small fires should be allowed
- Provide nutrients back to the soil
- **Salvage Logging**: removal of dead trees following a natural disturbance
    - Bad because:
        - povide nesting for animals
        - increses erosion

## Chapter 11
- Lots of high tech products require tantalum
    - Coltal = *col*umbite + *tan*talum
- **Rock**: solid aggregation of minerals
- **Mineral**: naturally occuring chemical element or inorganic compound with a stystam structure, a specific chemical composition, and distinct physical properties
    - Tantalite consists of oxygen, iron, and manganese
- Minerals are EVERYWHERE
- We obtain minerals and metals by **mining**: systemic removal of rock, soil, or other material for the purpose of extracting minerals of economic interest
- **Metal**: type of chemical element that typically is shiny, opaque, and malleable, and conduct heat and electricity
    - Most are in ore
- **Gangue**: waste rock and minerals that are not valuable
- Valuable metals include:
    1. iron
    2. lead
    3. gold
    4. nickel
- Nonmetalic materials include:
    1. sand
    2. gravel
    3. phosphates
    4. limestone
    5. gemstone
- Substances are mined for fuel
    1. Uranium
    2. Coal
    3. Peetrolium
    4. natural gas
- Make lakes out of quarries
- Processing mierals costs a lot of water and energy
    - emits air polution too
- **Tailings**: ore left over after metals have been extracted
    - pollutes soil water, and air
- Canada produces potash and asbestos
- Mining is a huge industry
    - $32 billion to the canadian economy
- **Strip Mining**: layers of soul and rock are removed to expose resource
- **Overburden**: overlaying soil and rock that is removed by heavy machinery
    - After mining, strip is refilled with overburden
    - Destroys natural communities over large areas and triggers erosion
- Some of the deepest mines extend 4km into the ground
- Chilli has lots of mines, some in the Andese mountains
- Walter likes Solution mining: resources in a deep deposit are displved in a liquid and siphoned out
