# Earth 122 Lecture 3 Jan 13th 2015 
## Chapter 2: Matter, Energy, and the Pysical Environment
### Points of this chapter
1. Funndamentals of matter and enrgy
2. Basic types of matter that are building blocks for all materials on earth
3. Differentiate among various types of energy and their roles in environmental systems
4. Describe how photosynthesis and cellular respiration turns energy into matter and back again
5. Plate tectonics and the rock cycles shaping the landscape around us
6. Main hypothesis for the origin of life

### Central Casel The unusual microbialities of Palvilion Lake
- Microbiolites: reeflike sedimentary structures composed of calcium carbonate of organic derivation
- Main interest in these is how they are formed
- Impacts the carbon cycle

- Chemistry is crucial for understanding:
    - How gases contribute to global climate change
        - Carbon dioxide and methane levels and the mechanisms that release them
            - Methane is a much more potant gas at retaining heat
            - Ex. swamps, natural gas wells
    - Polutants cause acid rain
    - The effects on wildlife and people
    - Water pollution
    - Wastewater treatment
    - Atmospheric ozone depletion
    - Energy issues
   
- Matter = All the material in the universe that has mass and occupies space.
    - Can be transofrmed from one substance into another
    - Cannot be destroyed or created
    - The law of conservation of matter

### Atoms, isotopes and Ions
- Emelemt = a fundemental type of matter with a given set of properties, compsed of atoms
- Atom = the smallest componets that maintain an element's chemical composition
- Earths crust: Oxygen (50%), Silicon (25%), Aluminuim (8%), Iron (5%)
- Isotopes = atoms with differing numbers of neutrons
- Mass Number = the combined number of protons and neutrons. 
- Isotopes of some elements behave differently
    - Radioactive vs stable
- Biodegridation is used to remove contaminants from ground water
    - Change isotopic composition of chemican and can remove its harm
    - By checking the compositions, scients can prove that biodegridation is occuring and save money since cleaning is done by the microbes
    - Can be used to determine where contanminants come from
    - Ex. using hydrogen and carbon isotope ratios to fingerprint where butterflies come from

### Radioactive decay
- Half life = The amount of time it takes for one half of the atoms to give off radiation and decay
    - Can cause issues with nuclear waste since we have to dispose of it properly
- Yucca mountain is an example of how the US disposes of waste because of the population desnity and its ruralness (no one lives there)
- All of the contries that use nuclear have to deal with the problem

Moecules vs Compounds
- Molecule contains one element
- Compunds compsed of two or more different elements
- Covalent bonds = atoms in a molecule that share elecetrons
- Polar covalent bonds = electrons shared unequally so one atom exerts a greater pull
- Ionic bond = an electron is transfered from one atom to another

### Water
- Hydrogen and polar covalent bonds
- Strong surfance tension
- Regulates temperature without changing state very often
- Less dense at lower temperatures (Ice floats on water because of more space between molecules)
- Water dissolves other molecules
    - Universal solvent
- Bonds well with other polar molecules
    - Important but can also have negative impacts since it can transport other bad molecules
- Transparent to light
    - Allows for plants to grow in the underwater

### Hydrogen Atoms
- Hydrogen ions control acidity
- Small number of water molecules dissociate; creates H+ and OH- ions
- Pure water has an equal number of H+ and OH-
- pH scale rnages from 0 to 14 and quantifies the acidity of solutions
- Acidic = pH < 7 (Car battery acid, extreme acid rain)
- Basic = pH > 7 (Ammonia)
- Neutral = pH = 7 (Pure water)
