# Earth 122 lecture 5 Jan 19th 2015
## A systems approach
- Environmental entities are complex sustems that interact with wachother
    - For example, river systems consist of hundreds of smaller tributary subsystems
    - Have differnet ponds in different areas, yet they are connected by rivers
    - Great lakes formed by glacier that used to be in the areas
- To solve environmnetal problems, all appropriate systems must be considered
    - Where to draw boundaties to study systems can be difficult
        - ex. How deep do we want to study?
    - Have to rely on computers to do some calculations
    - Traceing back the flow of materials can be used to study many systems
        - ex. waste from toronto can end up in the st. lawrence
    - Great lakes are connected by rivers.

## Environmental systems are percieved in various ways
- Categorizing environmental systems help make Earth's dazzling complexity comprehensible
- For example, the earth consists of structural spheres:
    - *Geosphere*: rocks and sediment
    - *Atmosphere*: the air
    - *Hydrosphere*: liquid, solid or water vapour
    - *Bioshpere*: all the planet's living organisms and the abiotic portions of the environment
- Boundaries overlap, so the systems interact
- Interavtions of biotic and abiotic compinents are key parts of ecology at the ecosystem level

## Ecosystems
- *Ecosystem*: all organisms and nonliving entities that occur and interact in a particular area at the same time
    - Includes abiotic (soil, rocks) and biotic components
    - Energy flows and matter cycles among the components
        - Energy entering the system is processed and transformed
        - Matter is recycled within the ecosystem, resulting in outputs such as heat, waterflow, and waste  products
            - Closed system
            - Sun (solar radiation) > Producers (photosynthesis) > Primary consumers (deer) > Secondary consumers (meat eaters that eat primary consumers) > Tertiary producers
                - Each of these consumers breathe (through respoeration) and release energy
                    - Brain uses lots of calories
                - Consumers die, and produce Detritus (non-living organic matter) provides energy to the producers
- Biological entities are highly intertwined with chemical and physical entitites
    - feedback loops
    - ex. Flow of water, sediment and nutrients from the St. Lawrence plays a key role in the near shore ecosystem of the Gulf of St. Lawrence
    - Amphibians are dependent on the nutruents and water provided by the watershed
- Ecosystems vary greatly in size
    - Small ecosystems (soil in a backyard)
    - Large ecosystems (watershed from great lakes into river)
- Adjacent ecosystems may share components and interact
- *Ecotones*: transitional zones between two ecosystems in which elements of different ecosystems mix
    - Ex. Forrests mixing with grasslands
    - *Patches*: from the landscape, and are distributted spatially in complex patterns (a *mosaic*)
    - *Landscape*: larger than an ecosystem and smaller than a biome
- Jefferson Salamadner
    - Mining company lowering water tables, and could take water out of ponds, endagering the salamanders

## Energy is converted to biomass
- *Gross primary production (GPP)*: conversion of solar energy to the energy of chemical bonds in sugars by autotrophs
- *Net primary production NPP)*: energy rememaining after resperation, ad is used to genereate biomass, organic material of which living organisms are formed
    - Variations amung ecosystems and biomes result in geographic patterns of variation accross the globe.
- *Secondary production*: biomass generated by heterotrophs due to consumption of autotrophs
- *Productivity* rate at which ecosystems generate biomass
- *High net primary productivity*: ecosystems whose plants rapidly convert solar energy to biomass (study chart on page 21 of lecture 3 slides)

## Nutrients availibility limits productivity
- *Nutrients*: elements and compunds required for survival that are consumed by nutrients
- *Macronutrients*: nutrients required in relative large amounts (Nitrogen, Carbon, phosphourus
- *Macronutrients*: nutrients needed in smaller amounts
- Nutrient runoff is devistating aquatic systems

## Ecosystem Services
- Birds provide pest controll
- Bees pollenate plants
- More on slide 28

## Important tools
- *Remote Sensing*: technologies that collect information about a target object from a distance
    - allows scientists to create a complete picture of the landscape
 - *Geographic information system (GIS)*: computer software used in landscape ecology research
    - Tries to integrate information from difference sources into one way more detailed source
    - Can really help Dertermine different boundaries to prevent damaging ecosystems

## Models
- *Model*: a simplified representation of a complex natural process, designed to help us understand how the process occurs and to make predictions
    - Great for testing many different types of scenarios
- Models are great for planning
- Pretty much models are great for predicting things because building anything
