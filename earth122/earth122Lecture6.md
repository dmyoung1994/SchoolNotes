# Earth 122 Lecture 6 January 22nd 2015
## Planet Earth Movie
- Grand Canyon
    - Lots of layers, like an onion
    - Horizontal layers tell geologists about rivers
    - Can date material in rocks due to radioactivity

- James Hutton
    - Scottish father of geology
    - Challenged rock theory by saying that rocks are created and destryed
    - Suggested that mountains were millions of years old, not thousands as was accepted
    - Pretty much came up with the cycle

- Alfred Vagener
    - Was intrigued that the same fossils were found oceans apart
    - Came up with the idea of pangea
    - Vision of moving contints dismissed at his time

- Rocks
    - Rocks pulled up only dated a couple million years suggesting that new rocks were being formed
    - Suggested towards sea floor spreading which is when new rock is formed by cooling lava, creating a new sea bed
    - Some rocks had different magnetic fields
        - Rock samples did actually suggest that the earths magnetic field switched from north to south a few million years ago
            - 9 north south flips in 4 million years

- Sea floor spreading
    - Lava portudes out of the crush, and then gets pushed further and further away as more molten rock pushes up
    - Confirmed when drilling cores further and further away from these portusions

- Lithosphere
    - Lava cooling into rock formes these plates
    - Makes up 20+ plates spread throught the world
    - Plates are floating on a bed of lava

- India/Asia plate
    - Sea Fossils on the himmilaya mountains tell us that there were once under water
    - India plate crashed into the Asia plate, pushing the rock up creating the himilayas

- San Andreas Fault
    - in 1908, the pacific plate lurched 20 feet in a minute agains the north american plate and release a lot of energy

- Hawaii Islands
    - Made up from volacnos eurupting
    - plate is moving over a plume of lava, creating new volcanos, and hence new Hawaii islands

- Misouri
    - Plotting earthquakes displayes how the plates shift
        - allows scientists to potentially predict new eathquakes

- Radiolaria
    - Once cell organisms embedded in rocks
    - Suggest that San Francisco is made up of chunks of land that migrated from somehwere else
