# Earth 122 Lecture 14
- The dust bowl was a monumental event in North America
    - Native prarie grasses origionally held erosion-prone soils in place
    - 1879-1929 widespread cultivation of wheat, and grazing has destroyed the prarie
    - Dust storms
        - Cause lung irritation, dust pneumonia, grasshopper infestations
        - Lots of dust storm in China
- Local environmental problems can turn into world wide problems
    - Dust storms from China have travelled accross the pacific, and affected countries in the east
- Stabalize deserted soil by planting a lot of trees to protect the lands from the wind
    - Too many trees will cause not enought water to be availible to the surface water features
- Soil degredation: problems and solutions
Problems | Solutions
--- | ---
Erosion | soil conservation
Desertification | Resoting plant cover
Salinization | Preventing salinization
Water logging | Better fertilization practices
Structural breakdown | better grazing practices

- Errosion control practices
    1. **Crop Rotation**: alternating the crops grown in the field from one season to the next
        - Protects the soil from being overused for certain nutrients
    2. **Intercropping**: Planting different types of crops in alternating grands or other spatially mixed arrangements to increase ground cover
    3. **Contour Farming**: plowing furrows sideways accross a hillside to prevent rills and gullies
    4. **Terracing**: level platforms are cut into hillsides forming a staircase to contain water
        - Rice farms
    5. **Shelterbelts or Windbreaks**: rows of tall perennial plants are planted along the edges of fields to slow the wind
        - **Alley Cropping**: shlterbelts + intercropping
    6. **Reduced Tillage**: furrows are cut in the soil, seed is dropped in and the furrow is closed
        - Reduces the amount of fresh soil exposed

- **Irrigation**: artificially providing water to support agriculture
- **Waterlogging**: over-irrigated soil which suffocates roots
- **Salinization**: the buildup of salts in surface soil layers
- Remidies for correcting once salinization has occured
    1. Choose crops appropriate to the area
    2. Irrigate with low-salt water
        - hard to remove salt from water
    3. Irrigate efficiently

## Chapter 8
- Canada was the first nation to prohibit patents on higher organisms (eg mice)
- Homoginization of food came with the industrialization of agriculture and genetic modification
    - All foods looks exactly the same everywhere
- Aggricultural land covers 38% of the Earth's landmass
- **Agriculture**: practice of rasing crops and livestock for human use and consumption
- **Cropland**: land used to raised plants for human use
- **Rangeland**: land used for grazing livestock
- Agriculture first appeared ~10,000 years ago
- Agriculture is a form of *intesification* - a way to increase productivity and carrying capacity of a given unit of land
- **Traditional Agriculture**: biologically powered agriculture, using human and animal muscle
- **Subsistence Agriculture**: families produce only enough food for themselves
- **Industrialized Agriculture**: using large scale mechanization and fossil fuels to boos yields
    - Vast fields of single type of crop leads to monoculture
    - Occupies 25% of the worlds cropland
- **Food Security**: the guarentee of an adequate, reliable and available food supply to all people at all times
    - Has implifications of soil health and over farming

## Nutrition
- **Undernourishment**: people that recieve less than 90% of their daily caloric needs
    - Mainly in developing countries
- **Malnurishment**: a shortage of nutrients the body needs
    - Diet lacks adequate vitamins and minerals 
- **Overnutrition**: recieving too many calories each day
    - In canda 48% of adults exeed their heathy weight and 14% are obese

## Green Revolution
- **Green Revolition**: increases in agricultural productivity during the mid to late 20th century
    - Increased food production
    - Devoting more enrgy
    - Greatly increase use of irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides
    - Both positive and negative impacts
- **Extensification**: bringing more land into preduction
- Fertilizer Impacts
    - Inorganic
        - industrial fertilizers are mined or synthetically manufactured (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
    - Organic
        - Natural materials such as animal manure, crop residues, fresh vegitation, compost
    - Runoffs can lead to phytoplankton blooms nad pose human health risks

## Pesticides
- 91% of pesticide sales are for agricultural purposes
- 85% of pesticices sold in Canada are herbicides
- Persistant in the environment and dont easily break down
- Pests evolved to resists pesticides over time
