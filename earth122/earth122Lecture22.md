# Earth122 Lecture 22
- Concrete and backtops causes water to flow faster
- Water gets diverted away from where it naturally wants to go
    - Once the water gets to its destination, just a trickle is left1
- Lakes drying up dramatically alter ecosystems that were there like fish
    - Due to our need for water
- Excessive use of water in many parts of the wrold like central canada, central US, china, india
- Effects our food prices
- Wetlands have been treated as "useless swamps"
    - Important because it provides habitat for migratory birds
- Sinkholes caused by lack of groundwater
- Taking groundwater from sea side places causes salt water intrution
- some cities are slowly sinking 
- The San Joaquin Valley has subsided 10 meters in 50 years
    - So much water from the ground has been pumped that the land sank over time
- Aquitards are made by clay 
    - Compresses greatly when the water is pumped out 
- Water level was higher than the ground level back in the early 1900's
    - Water level has decreases greatly in the Industrial zone especially
    - Stopping ground water pumping allows water level to recover
- Injection wells allow water to be added to aquifers
    - After Aquitards have been dried, its hard to resore water to them
- Imagine what happens to infrastructure when cities start to sink
- Sea levels arent changing, so when land subsides bad stuff happens
- Solutions to this problem are:
    - Building gates to alter water levels, practially just a big ass lock to alter water levels
        - Alters water circulation and depletes oxygyn in the water
    - Lowering demand for water
    - Increasing supply
- Desalinizing water removes salt from water, increasing the qunatity of water availible
    - Expensive
- How to save water? Dont be wasterful
- Water can be contaminated and harm human health
- DDT has still been found in aquifers 40 years after it has been banned
