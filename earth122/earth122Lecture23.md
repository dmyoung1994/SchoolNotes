# Earth 122 Lecture 23
- High humidities makes it a muggy and uncomfortable
- Atmosphere averages the temperature out
    - Helps create seasons and causes air to circulate
- Angle that is caused from sunloght hitting the eartch changes the sunlight per unit area (more dispersed => colder)
- Earth is tilted by 23.5%
- Weather vs Climate
    - Weather is region specific and short time period
    - Climate is global and long time period
- Iversion layes occur where mountains are surround the city
    - Traps pollution inside

## Air Pollution
- Certain primary pollutants cause secondary pollutants
- Lots off agreements to try and monitor and slow down air pollution
    - Listed in slides
- Severe decrease of lead in the air is a direct concequence of policies
- Smog is the most widespread air quality problem
- Electric cars are not all emission free
    - Electricity has to be made somehow (coal burning)
- Industrial and commercial production causes a lot of secondary pollutants
- 80% of Asian cities have emissions above the safety threshold set by WHO
- Ozone layer is 12-30km up in the stratosphere
    - Protects us from ultraviolet radiation
- What happens when the ozone whole starts migrating
    - Why is the whole congregated towards the antartic?
- Addition of water to the pollution really seems to cause secondary pollutants like acid rain
- 5,500 people die per day from indoor air pollution
- Pollution can seep into furniture and be release slowly over time and harm peoples health
- Vapour intrusion: when pollution volotilizes and migrates in the subsurface which seep into homes
- Walter says basement ventilation is very important so that the air you breath is cleaner

## Global Climate Change
- Athabaska glacier has retreated 1.5km since 1844
- Not all gasses are created equal, they all have different abilities to trap heat
