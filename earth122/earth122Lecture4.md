# Earth 122 Lecture 4 January 15 2015
## Geological Systems
- Earth consists of layers:
    - *Core*: the planet's center, consiting of mostly iron
        - Solid in the inner core and Molten in the outer core
    - *Mantle* surrounds the core, thick layer of rock
- Plate Techtonics
    - Plates that move
    - Can create faults, mountains, rifts, and volcanos
        - Divergent (move apart)
        - Transform (move along eachother)
        - Convergent (move together)
    - Can create:
        - Earthquakes to relieve built up pressure
        - Volcanic eurptions from molten rock
            - "Ring of Fire"
        - Landlides
        - Tsunamis (waves created by earthquakes)
            - Japan is a good example of how these things can destroy
                - Nuclear melt down and massive radiation leak
                - Dealing with contamination and modeling the transportation of radiation through mediums like water and soil

## Evolution of the environment
- 200 million years ago:
    - *Pangea*, the anciant super continent, combined all the worlds continents into a single land mass
        - Evidence is gathered through fossils, and minerals  of certain species in places they shouldn't be
- 4.5 billion years ago:
    - Very hostile
    - Severe volcanic and tectonic activity
    - Intense ultraviolet energy from the sun
    - No oxygen existed in atmosphere until photosynthesis developed in microbes
    - No life existed

## Rock cycle
- Rock:
    - Naturally occuring, solid aggregation of minerals
    - Type of rick influences a region's soil and also plant community
- Mineral:
    - Naturally occuring solid element or inorganic compound that has a crystal structure, specific chemical composition, and sitinct physical properties
        - building block of rocks
- Igneous rock (formed from cooling lava)
    - Intrusive (granite)
    - Extrusive (basalt)
    - Can become metamorphic rock from heating and pressure
- Sedimentary rock (formed from weathering and erosion)
    - Limestone
    - Sandstone
    - Sediments become sedimentary rock through Lithification
    - Sedimentary rock becomes sediments through weathering, etc
- Metamorphic rock (form when rock is subject to great heat and pressure)
    - Limestone compressed and heated to form marble
    - Shale compressed and heated to form slate
    - Can become sediments through weathering, erosion, transport, and deposition

## Lifes Origin
- Many hypotheses to explain life's origin
- *Primordial Soup (the heterotrophic hypothesis)*
    - Life originated from a "primordial soup" of simple inorganic chemicals in the oceans
    - First life forms used organic compunds for energy
- *"Seeds" from space (the panspermia hypothesis)*
    - mocrobes from space traveled on meteorites to earth
- *Life from the depths (the chemoautotropgic hypothesis)*
    - Life orignated in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, with abundant sulfur
    - First organisms were chemautotrophs

## Chpter Summary
- The chemical basis of matter, the nature of energy, and the geological processes that have shaped our planet and provide the physical foundations for out present-dat environment and allow life to exist
- Understanding the characteristics and interactions of matter that can provide tools for finding solutons to environmental problems
- An understanding of energy is of great scientific importancance as well as considerable practical relevance
- Physical processes of geology are centrally important because they shape Earth's terrain and form the foundations for living systems
- Understading how life originated enhances our understanding of how present-day organisms interat with one another, and how they relate to their nonliving environment, and how environmental systems funtion

# Chapter 3
## St. Lawrence Belugas Case study
- Decreaing pupulation die to gastrointenstinal cancer from pollutants (PAHs from fossil fules)
- *Biomagnificaton* of contaminants through food chain
    - Small creatures pass the contaminants up the food chain to Belugas
- PAHs come from as far away as the Golden Horshoe in Ontario
- PAHs are lipophuluc -> *bioaccumulation*
- Belugas considered threatened now

## Systems
- *System*: a network of relationships among parts, elements, or components that interact with and inflence one another
    - Exchange of energy, matter, or information
    - REcieves input of energy, matter, or information -> proccess these inputs -> produce outputs
    - hard to understand and predict
- *Open System*: Systems that recieve inputs of both energy and matter and produce both of outputs
- *Closed Systems*: Systems that recieve inputs and produce outputs of energy, but not matter
- *Feedback loop*: A System's output serves as input to the same system
    - *Negative Feedback Loop*: Output that resuslts from a system moving in one direction acts as input that moves the system in the other direction
        - Acts as a stablizer to the system
        - Ex. Brain regulating body temperature
    - *Positive Feedback Loop*: instead of stablizing a system, it drives it further toward one extreme or another
        - Snowball effect
        - Ex. Ice melting reduces light reflected, warming up the temperature even more
        - Ex. Permafrost melting releases methane which furher worsens the problem

### System in a steady state
- *Dynamic equilibrium*: System processes move in opposing directions at equivilent rates, balancing their effects
- *Homeostatis* is a state of balance
    - Homeostatis is a system that maintains contant or stable internal conditions
        - *Resistance* refers to the strength of the system's tendency to remain constant
            - Strength to protect
        - *Resilience* is a measure of how readily the system will return to its original state once it has been desturbed
- *Emergent properties*: system characteristics not evident in the components alone
    - Have to study more than just the parts of a system (maybe how they interact)
