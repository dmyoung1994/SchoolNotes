# Earth 122 Lecture 4 January 15 2015
## Geological Systems
- Earth consists of layers:
    - *Core*: the planet's center, consiting of mostly iron
        - Solid in the inner core and Molten in the outer core
    - *Mantle* surrounds the core, thick layer of rock
- Plate Techtonics
    - Plates that move
    - Can create faults, mountains, rifts, and volcanos
        - Divergent (move apart)
        - Transform (move along eachother)
        - Convergent (move together)
    - Can create:
        - Earthquakes to relieve built up pressure
        - Volcanic eurptions from molten rock
            - "Ring of Fire"
        - Landlides
        - Tsunamis (waves created by earthquakes)
            - Japan is a good example of how these things can destroy
                - Nuclear melt down and massive radiation leak
                - Dealing with contamination and modeling the transportation of radiation through mediums like water and soil

## Evolution of the environment
- 200 million years ago:
    - *Pangea*, the anciant super continent, combined all the worlds continents into a single land mass
        - Evidence is gathered through fossils, and minerals  of certain species in places they shouldn't be
- 4.5 billion years ago:
    - Very hostile
    - Severe volcanic and tectonic activity
    - Intense ultraviolet energy from the sun
    - No oxygen existed in atmosphere until photosynthesis developed in microbes
    - No life existed

## Rock cycle
- Rock:
    - Naturally occuring, solid aggregation of minerals
    - Type of rick influences a region's soil and also plant community
- Mineral:
    - Naturally occuring solid element or inorganic compound that has a crystal structure, specific chemical composition, and sitinct physical properties
        - building block of rocks
- Igneous rock (formed from cooling lava)
    - Intrusive (granite)
    - Extrusive (basalt)
    - Can become metamorphic rock from heating and pressure
- Sedimentary rock (formed from weathering and erosion)
    - Limestone
    - Sandstone
    - Sediments become sedimentary rock through Lithification
    - Sedimentary rock becomes sediments through weathering, etc
- Metamorphic rock (form when rock is subject to great heat and pressure)
    - Limestone compressed and heated to form marble
    - Shale compressed and heated to form slate
    - Can become sediments through weathering, erosion, transport, and deposition

## Lifes Origin
- Many hypotheses to explain life's origin
- *Primordial Soup (the heterotrophic hypothesis)*
    - Life originated from a "primordial soup" of simple inorganic chemicals in the oceans
    - First life forms used organic compunds for energy
- *"Seeds" from space (the panspermia hypothesis)*
    - mocrobes from space traveled on meteorites to earth
- *Life from the depths (the chemoautotropgic hypothesis)*
    - Life orignated in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, with abundant sulfur
    - First organisms were chemautotrophs

## Chpter Summary
- The chemical basis of matter, the nature of energy, and the geological processes that have shaped our planet and provide the physical foundations for out present-dat environment and allow life to exist
- Understanding the characteristics and interactions of matter that can provide tools for finding solutons to environmental problems
- An understanding of energy is of great scientific importancance as well as considerable practical relevance
- Physical processes of geology are centrally important because they shape Earth's terrain and form the foundations for living systems
- Understading how life originated enhances our understanding of how present-day organisms interat with one another, and how they relate to their nonliving environment, and how environmental systems funtion
