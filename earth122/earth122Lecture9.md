# Earth 122 Lecture 8 February 3rd 2015 Chapter 4 cont
## Evolution
- I missed last class so the start of Chapter 4 notes are missing
- *Phylogenetic Trees* are diagrams that scientists use to trace when cetrain traits evolved
    - It shows relationships between species
- Origin of life is about 4 billion years ago
- Evidence of animal life only comes about 750 million years ago
- The species that come about through evolution dont last forever
    - Diversity of species over time has increased, but the species alive today are only a fraction of species that have been on earth
- *Extinction*: the dissapearence of a species from earth
    - A natural process
    - Human impact can profoundly affect the rate at which it happens
    - Is irreversible, once a species is lost it is lost forever
    - Extinction broungth on by human impact may well be the biggest environmental problem we face
- *Background extinction rate*: extinction ussually occusts one species at a time
- *Mass extintion events*: events that killed off massive numbers of species at once
    - There have been 5 of these events in Earths history
    - 50-95% of all species went extinct at one time
    - Most known event happened 65 million years ago and ended dinosaurs
        - Particles block sunlight -> plants die -> autotrophs cant survive -> meat eaters cant survive -> EVERYONE DIES
    - Humans are causing the 6th event due to:
        - Resource depletion
        - Population growth
        - Development
        - Introduction of invasive species
- *Endemic Species*: a species that only exists in a certain, specilized area
    - These species are seceptible to extinction and have small popilations
- Species ranges can be severely restricted
    - Vancouver Island Marmot
        - Logging activities are endangering these cute little guys

## Ecology
- *Biosphere*: the total living things on Earth and the areas they inhabit
- *Ecosystem*: communities and the nonliving material they interact with
- *Community*: interating species that live in the same area
- *Population ecology*: investigates qunatitative dynamics of how individuals within a species interact
- *Community Ecology*: focuses on interations among species
- *Ecosystem ecology*: studies living and nonliving components of a system to reveal patterns
    - ex Nutrient and energy flows
- *Habitat*: the environment in which an organism lives
    - included living and nonliving elements
    - Scale dependent: the size of the organisms habitat is relative to its size
- *Habitat use*: each organism thrives in certain habitats, but not in others
    - Humback whales have traveled over long distances
        - Reproduce in Hawaiin islands, then head back into harsher envionments to live
- *Habitat selection*: the process by which organisms actively select habitats in which we live
    - Availibility and quality of habitat are crutial to an organism's well being
    - Human development conflicts with this process
        - Mid-west united states was a huge prarie, turned intto rich human farmland
- *Niche*: an organism's use of resources and its functional role in a community
    - Habitat use, food selection, role in energy and nutrient flow
    - Optimal functional role in an organisms communitity
- *Specialists*: species with narrow niches and very specific requirements
    - Extremely good at what they do, but vulnurable to change
    - Ex. Koala bear, need eucaliptis trees, and eating them is all it really does
- *Generalists*: species with broad niches that can use a wide array of habitats and resources
    - Able to live in many different places
    - Ex. Racoons
- *Population*: individual of the same species inhabiting a particular area
    - Species may consist of multiple populations that are geographically isolated from one another
- Populations show characterists that help scientists pretice their future dynamics
    - *Population Size*: the number of individual organisms present at a given time
        - Numbers can increase, decrease, cucle, or remain the same
        - Canadas population is increasing mainly due to immegration
    - *Population Density*: the number of individuals within a populatuon per unit area
        - Higer densities make it easier to find mates, but increase competition, and vulnerability to predation and disease transmition
        - Lower densities make it harder to find mates, but individuals enjoy plentiful resources and space
    - *Population distribution (dispersion)*: spatial arrangement of organisms within an area
        - Random: haphazardly located individuals with no patterns
            - Ex. forrests
        - Uniform: individuals that are evenly spaced due to territoriality
            - Ex. Seaguls or birds
        - Clumped: arranged according to availiblity of resources
            - Most common type in nature
            - Due to the behaviour (sardines)
                - They seem bigger as a group, rahter than an individual
            - Concentrated by resources
            - Some habitats may be better than others
    - *Sex Ratio*: proportion of males to females
        - In monogamous species, a 50/50 sex ratio maximizes population growth
        - Unbalanced ratio leaves many individuals of one sex without mates
        - Ex. In China, more males than females and may have altered the sex ratio
    - *Age Structure*: the relative numbers of organisms of each age within a population
        - Age structure diagrams (pyramids) show the structure of populations
    - *Crude birth/death rates*: number of births or deaths per 1000 individuals for a given time period
    - *Survivorship curves*: to show likelihod of death varies with age
        - Type 1: more deaths at older ages
        - Type 2: equal number of deaths at all ages
        - Type 3: more deaths at young ages
        - [Example curve](http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/42/6542-004-BE57D88E.jpg)
- Population growth, stability or devline is determined by 4 factors
    1. Natality: births within the population
    2. Mortality: deaths within the population
    3. Immigration: arrival of individuals from outside the population
    4. Emigration: departure of individuals from a population
- Growth Rate = (crude birthrate + immigration) - (crude death rate + emigration)
- Steady growth rates cause *exponential* population growth
    - something increases by a fixed percent
    - graphed as a J-shaped curve
    - Cannot be sustained indefinitely
- *Limiting Factors*: physical, chemical and biological characteristics that restrain population growth
    - water
    - space
    - food
    - predators
    - disease
- *Environmental resistance*: all limiting facotrs taken together
- *Logistic growth curve*: S-shaped curve used to model population growth
    - exponention growth at early time
    - stabalized population size at late time due to limiting factors
- Humans have raised their carrying capacity by decreasing the carrying capacity for other species
- Perfect logistic curves are rarely found in nature
    - Except in pietry dishes where everything is monitored
    - Limiting facotrs effect the shape of the curve
- *Biotic potential*: the ability (maximum capacity) of an organism to produce offspring
    - Fish vs Whales
- *K-slected species*: animals with long gestation periods and have few offspring
    - Have a low biotic potential
    - Stabalize at or near carrying capacity
    - Good competitors
- *R-selected species*: animals which reporduce quickly
    - Have high biotic potential
    - Little parental care
- Study table 4.4 on slide 48 to know characteristics between the two types of species
- As population in one species declines, other species may appear

## Chapter 5: Species Interations and Community Ecology
- Zebra Muscle is a prime example of an evasive species
    - Within 2 years, these guys invaded all 5 Great Lakes
    - Grew exponentially since they have no natural predators, competitors or parasites
    - Diagram of their effects on slide 4
- *Competition*: relationship where multiple organisms seek the same limited resources
    - Like food, water, space, shelter, mates, sunlinght
- *Intraspecific Competition*: among members of the smae species
    - High population density = increased competition
- *Interspecific Competition*: among member of two or more species
    - Ean lead to either competitive exclusion or to species coexistance
- *Resource Partitioning*: species divide shared resources by specalizing in different ways
    - Avoids competition
    - Ex. One species is active at night, another in the day time
    - Ex. One species eats small seeds, another eats large seeds
- Resource partitioning can lead to **Character Displacement**: competing species evolve physical characteristics that reflect their reliance on the portion of the resource they use
- Interaction between species:
    - **Predation**
    - **parasitism**
    - **Herbivory**
