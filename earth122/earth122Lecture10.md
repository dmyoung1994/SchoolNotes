## Chapter 5 cont
- Predation can drive populaton dynamics by causing cycles in population size
    - Prey increase, predators increase -> prey decrease, predators decrease
- Natural Selection leads to evolution
 - Predators: evolve adaptations that makes them better hunters
 - Prey: evolve devenses against being eaten
    - Male pheasents evloved to look pretty to attract females
    - Femlae pheasents evolved to look ugly to blend in and stay hidden
- Parasites exploit living hosts
    - Some species live within hosts such as protists that cause disease (malaria)
        - tapeworms
    - Some are free living and live on their own
        - ticks
        - sea lampreys
- Herbivores do not kill plants, but effect its growth
    - Plants grow defenses too
- **Symbolisis**: mutalism in which organisms live in close physical contact
    - Mobrobes within digestive tract
    - Plants and fungi
        - Trees provide area for fungus to grow, fungus provide nutrients back to plants
- **Pollination**: bees, bats, and birds transfer pollen from one flower to another, fertilizing its eggs, and resulting in fruit
- **Amensalism**: a relationship which one organism is harmed while the other is uneffected
    - Sheep/cows trampling grass
    - **Allelopathy**: certain plants release harmful chemicals
- **Commensalism**: a relationship in which one organism benifits, while the other remains uneffected
    - **Facilitation**: plants that create shate and leaf litter allow seedlings to grow

## Ecological Communities
- **Community**: an assemblage of species living in the same place at the same time
    - Members interact with eachother
- Energy passes among trophic levels
    - **Trophic Levels**: rank in feeding hierarchy
        - Producers: first level
            - Autotrophs (self feeders)
            - Green Plants
            - Cyanobacteria
                - Thought to be one of the first species to generate oxygen through photosynthesis
            - Algae
            - Chemosyntheric bacteria (use geothermic energy in hot springs to produce their own food
        - Consumers: Organisms that consime producers
            - **Primary Consumer**
                - Organisms that consume producers
                - Herbavours such as deer, grasshoppers
            - **Secondary Consumers**
                - Organisms that prey on primary consumers
                - Carnivores such as wolves and tigers
            - **Tertiary Consumers**
                - Consume secondary consumers
                - Also carnivores such as hawks and owels
            - **Detritivoures and decomposers**
                - Organisms that consume nonliving organic matter
                    - enrich soils and.or recycle nutrients found in dead organisms
                - Play an important role in how water moves through the subsurface
                    - Things like worm holes provide ways for air to move into the soil
- Most energy organisms use is lost as waste heat through respiration
    - Each trophic level contains only 10% of the energy of the prophic level below it
- Organisms at lower trophic levels generally exist in far greater numbers, with greater energy and biomass than organisms above it

## Chains and Webs
- **Food Chain**: the relationship how energy is transfered up the trophic levels
- **Food Web**: a visual map of feeding relationships and energy flow
- **Keystone Species**: A species that has a particularly strong or far-reaching impact in ecological comminities
    - Kelp forests

## Dealing with disturbance
- **Succession**: the predictable series of changes in a community following a disturbance
    - **Primary Succession**: disturbance eliminates all vegetation and/or soil life
        - Asteroid impact
        - Godzilla
        - Glaciers
        - Drying lakes
        - Volcanic Lava
    - **Secondary Succession**: disturbance dramatically alters, but does not destroy all organisms
        - The remaining organisms form building blocks for the next population species
        - Fires
        - Hurricanes
        - Farming
        - Logging
- **Pioneer Species** the first species to arrive in a primary succession area
- **Climax Community**: the community resulting from a successful succession
    - Remains stable until another disturbance restarts succession

## Invasive Species
- **Invasive Species**: non-native (exotic) organisms that spread widely and become dominant in a community
    - Can be bad and wipe out other species
        - Asian Carp
        - Black Bass
        - Zebra muscles
    - Can be good and help people
        - European honeybee
- Techniques to control invasive species include:
    - Remove manually
    - Toxic chemicals
    - Drying them out
    - Deprivation of exygen
    - Stressing them 
        - heat, sound, electricity, carbon dioxide, light
    - Prevention, rahter than control, is the best policy

## Ecological Restoration
- **Ecological Restoration**: returning a area to earlier conditions
- Difficult, time consuming, and expensive
- Best to protect rather than restore in the first place
- Saltwater intrusion due to pumping of ground water
- Canals accelerated the flow of freshwater to the ocean

## Earths Biomes
- **Bione**: major regional complex of similar communities, recognized by
    - plant type
    - vegitation structure
1. Tundra
    - Canada, Scandinavia, Russia
    - Minimal precipitation
        - Nearly as dry as a desert
    - Extreamly cold winters
    - Permafrost
    - Few Animals
    - Low vegitation with few trees
2. Boreal Forst
    - Northern coniferous forest
    - Canada, Alaska, Russia, Scandinavia
    - Cool and dry climate
        - Long, cold winters
        - Short, cool summers
    - Few evergreen tree species
    - Moose, wolves, bears, migratory birds
3. Temerate Deciduous Forests
    - **Deciduous trees** lose their leaves each fall and remain dormant during the winter
    - Mid-latitude forests in Europe, China, and Eastern North America
    - Fertime soils
    - Forrests = oak, beech, maple
4. Temperate Grasslands
    - More extreme temperature difference between winter and summer
    - Less precipitation
    - Also called steppes or prairies
    - Much was converted for agriculture
    - Bison, Prairie dogs, antilope, ground-nesting birds
