## Supply - Where does our water come from?

- Lots of student campaigns to not sell bottled water on campus
- Every 15 minutes, the city tests the water
- Bottled water regulated by the food and agriculture industry
    - Tested every week
    - Tap water is way more regulated
- Bottled water consumes 17 million barrels of oil regularly
- 23% of water bottles are recycled every year
- Virtual water is the water embedded in products
    - Virtual water trade is importing and exporting goods that have water in them
- Water removed from the hydrologic cycle is gone and can never come back
    - Effects the climate and the environment
- Water wars
    - Will the world start fighting over water once it becomes scarcer?
    - Now, even if countries are fighting, they will cooperate over water
- Out of all water, 2.5% is fresh water
    - 1% is surface fresh water
        - 1% is within organisms
        - 1% is in rivers
        - 8% is atmospheric water vapour
        - 38% is soil moisture
        - 52% is lakes
    - 20% is ground water
    - 79% is ice caps or glaciers
- Oceans provide the most water in the hydro cycle
    - Ice caps, glaciers, and snofields are second
    - Groundwater is third
- Ducks like to reporduce in wetlands
- Oak Ridges marine is the aquifer which waterloo is located
- Water scarcity is having less that 1000 liters per capita per year
- Lots of plcaes in Africa have lots of water, but dont have the means to get it
- Mid latitude rain belt has moved upward

## Demand - How do we use water?
- Developed countries use water for industrial consumption
- Developing countries use water for agriculture
- In Canada, each of us use 87 liters of water per day
- Some dams are being destroyed
- Some dams get breached
